# Tree Data Structure
This repository contains various implementations and algorithms related to data structures, specifically focusing on binary trees and binary search trees (BSTs) in C#. The project serves as a practical resource for understanding and applying tree-based data structures, alongside algorithmic techniques for solving common problems.

Key Features
Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation:

Create a binary search tree that allows insertion of values while maintaining the BST property.
Methods to validate if a given tree is a valid binary search tree by ensuring all left subtrees are less than the current node and all right subtrees are greater.
Path Sum Calculations:

Functionality to determine if there is a root-to-leaf path where the sum of the node values equals a given target.
Calculation of the maximum path sum from any node to any node in the binary tree.
Tree Traversal and Properties:

Functions to calculate the right view of the binary tree without using a queue, displaying nodes visible from the right side.
A method to list all odd-valued nodes in the binary tree.
Mirror Trees:

A method to check if two trees are mirror images of each other.
Balanced Tree Verification:

A function to determine if a binary tree is balanced by checking the heights of subtrees.
Custom Binary Tree Node Class:

A simple implementation of a Node class representing each node in the binary tree, with properties for data and left/right child nodes.
Sample Implementations
Insert and Validate: Sample code for inserting nodes into a binary search tree and validating the tree structure.
Maximum Path Sum: A complete implementation to find the maximum path sum in the binary tree, along with testing code for different scenarios.
Traversal: Methods for right view traversal and listing odd nodes, showcasing different traversal techniques without relying on queues.

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a learning tool for those interested in understanding binary trees and algorithms related to them. You are encouraged to contribute by adding new features, optimizing existing code, or reporting issues.
